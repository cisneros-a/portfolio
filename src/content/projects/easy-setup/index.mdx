With this project, I had to think about how my decisions early on would affect the application on larger scale. In particular, I had to think about the data models. This would help define the structure of my app. I decided on a single user model with a type of "tenant" or "landlord" depending on which side of the app is being utilized at the moment. This provides a more uniform exeperince overall for users despite thier different use cases.
