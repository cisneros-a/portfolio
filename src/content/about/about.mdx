I've always been interested in problem solving and finding a way to express myself creatively. Coding gave me both.

Soon after finishing my first Python tutorial on YouTube, I was sold and enrolled in Flatiron School's Software Engineering Bootcamp. There I gained a deep understanding and practical knowledge of React, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails. It was an invaluable experience.

I'm ready to take my skills and passion of coding and apply them in a professional setting. Please feel free to take a look at my projects and reach out to me!
